Digital Art
====
Last updated: 7 June 2018  
  
While on vacation, I noticed some new abstract art on the Norwegian Jade, some of which I really liked.  Several of the pieces looked like they might have been generated by a computer or a human artist using digital techniques.  So I took photos of most of the pieces to see if I could recreate some aspects of the art using digital methods.  The goal of this project, using the computer codes, is to create abstract compositions.  Abstract art is a type of art that is free to represent emotion or ideas in imagery that can depart from photo accurate representations of reality.  
  
This project will make use of the following computer codes.   
- Python: [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.  
Matplotlib: [Matplotlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib) is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.  
- Numpy: [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.  
- OpenCV: [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

- PIL: [Python Imaging Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library) (abbreviated as PIL) (in newer versions known as Pillow) is a free library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

Python scripts will used to generate the output files as opposed to editing or drawing images with graphic editors such as (GIMP)[https://www.gimp.org/docs/python/index.html].  

The output file format is JPEG.  [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography.  Other image formats can easily be used since they are supported by python libraries.   
 
The following starter template is proposed:  
~~~
import cv2
import PIL
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
#plt.subplots_adjust(left=None, bottom=None, right=None, top=None, wspace=None, hspace=None)
for color in ['red', 'green', 'blue']:
    n = 50
    x, y = np.random.rand(2, n)
    scale = 200.0 * np.random.rand(n)
    ax.scatter(x, y, c=color, s=scale, label=color,
               alpha=0.3, edgecolors='none')

plt.axis('off')
#plt.axis('equal')
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
plt.show()

fig.set_size_inches(5.0, 5.0)
fig.savefig('test_example.jpg', dpi=100)
plt.close()

PIL.Image.open('test_example.jpg')

Projects:  
- Re-create some abstract art from example photos  
- digitally manipulate photographs to make abstractions  
- paint blobs
